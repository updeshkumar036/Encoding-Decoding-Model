What is Cryptography?
-It is associated with the process of cob=nverting ordinary plain text into unintelligible text and vice-versa.It is a method of storing and transmitting data in a particular form so that only those for whom it is intended can read and process it.
Related Terms:
PlainText: it is the data to be protected during transmission.
Encryption Algorithm: it is a mathematical process that produces a ciphertext for any given plaintext and encryption key.it is a cryptographic algorithm that takes plaintext and an encryption key as input and produces a ciphertext.
Ciphertext:It is the scrambled version of the plaintext produced by the encryption algorithm using a specific encryption key. The ciphertext is not guarded.It flows on a public channel.It can be intercepted or compromised by anyone who has access to the communication channel.
Decryption Algorithm:It is a mathematical process, that produces a unique plaintext for any given ciphertext and decryption key. It is a cryptographic algorithm that takes a ciphertext and a decryption key as input and outputs a plaintext. The decryption algorithm essentially reverses the encryption algorithm and is thus closely related to it.
